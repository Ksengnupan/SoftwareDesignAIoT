#M5 Core 2 **BLE detector**

* Core 2 will work as BLE detector and will be detecting every BLE devices nearby. RSSI threshold is set. We can also change the ```RSSI_THRESHOLD``` for any desire values as this threshold will depend on the environment being noisy or not.

* We will make a list of registered BLE devices. Collected BLE tags will be added to the known BLE devices list.

* Firstly, the Core 2 will check whether the detected BLE devices are included in the known BLE devices list. If yes, the BLE mac addresses will be compared and displayed on serial monitor as” Found Registered Device” with their respective received signal strength values.
